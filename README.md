util scripts to prepare data for im2markup project  

# build scg ink lib  
python setup.py bdist --format=gztar  


#unit testing:  
python -m unittest discover -v  
or  
python -m unittest net.wyun.tests.prep.test_batch.TestBatch.test_all  

logging configuration file:   
logging.conf  

#Pycharm unittest configure  
1. setup testing framework to be unittest  
2. in 'edit configuration...' menu, select root of the project  
    as the working directory

#this project is the preprocess step for training the im2markup model  
1. select all valid inkml files with latex truth  
2. for all valid inkml files, separate them into 3 groups:  
   a. train, b. validate, c. test  
3. see test_batch.py for more info.  
 
# useage:
1. copy all your inkml(with latex truth, the file would be discarded if no latex groundtruth)  
   to data/batch/inkml folder.  
2. copy all your xlsx file to data/xlsx/ folder  
3. at the root of the project, run process.sh  
4. it would generate im2markup training data: images in a folder + 4 lst files as shown in this screen  
shot. They are located in data/batch/ folder.  
5. compress data/batch/ folder to batch.tar.gz  
6. scp batch.tar.gz to training server, such as cuda2.  
7. on training server, make a soft link:  
xy00@cuda2:~/im2latex_tf$ ll formula_imageslrwxrwxrwx 1 xy00 xy00 32 Nov 10 00:19 formula_images -> /home/xy00/batch/formula_images//
8.  cp these 4 lst file to xy00@cuda2:~/im2latex_tf  
9. remove old model files  
10. run bash file: ./bash_train.sh in xy00@cuda2:~/im2latex_tf/
